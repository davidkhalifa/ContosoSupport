# Tutorial: ContosoSupport

The `ContosoSupport` project is an **ASP.NET Core API application** that serves as the public interface for a customer support ticketing system. It manages core entities like *support cases* and *support persons*, handling requests for their creation, retrieval, update, and deletion. The application leverages **Azure Cosmos DB** for data storage and is designed for deployment on **Azure Service Fabric**, with its infrastructure defined and managed using **Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates** for automated provisioning. **OpenTelemetry** and **Geneva Monitoring** are integrated throughout to provide comprehensive observability and performance monitoring.

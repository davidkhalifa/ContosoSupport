# ContosoSupport Service Extension - Support Cases Assignment Fields

## Functional Specification Document

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** July 29, 2025  
**Document Type:** Functional Specification  
**Service:** ContosoSupport REST API Extension

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This document specifies the functional requirements for extending the existing ContosoSupport support cases model with assignment tracking capabilities. The extension introduces two new fields to support intelligent assignment and provide transparency in AI-driven support person allocation decisions.

---

## 2. Current System Overview

### 2.1 Existing Support Cases Model
The ContosoSupport service currently manages support cases with basic ticket information including case ID, title, description, status, priority, and owner. However, the current model lacks structured support person assignment tracking and reasoning capabilities.

### 2.2 Current Limitations
- No standardized field for tracking assigned support personnel
- Lack of transparency in assignment decision-making
- No mechanism to store AI reasoning for assignments
- Limited ability to query cases by assigned support person
- Absence of assignment audit trail

---

## 3. Extension Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system SHALL extend the support cases model to include support person assignment tracking
- **FR-002**: The system SHALL provide transparent AI reasoning for assignment decisions
- **FR-004**: The system SHALL support querying cases by assignment status and assigned person

#### 3.1.2 Assignment Management
- **FR-006**: The system SHALL support assignment updates and reassignments


### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements

#### 3.2.1 Performance
- **NFR-001**: Assignment operations SHALL complete within 2 seconds for 95% of requests
- **NFR-002**: Query operations with assignment filters SHALL maintain sub-second response times

#### 3.2.2 Backward Compatibility
- **NFR-005**: Existing API endpoints SHALL continue to function without modification
- **NFR-006**: New fields SHALL be nullable to support existing unassigned cases

ALTER TABLE support_cases 
ADD COLUMN assigned_support_person VARCHAR(50) NULL
    COMMENT 'Alias of the assigned support person',

    COMMENT 'Reasoning for the support person assignment';

-- Add foreign key constraint
ALTER TABLE support_cases
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_support_cases_assigned_person

## 7. Validation and Business Logic

### 7.1 Assignment Validation Rules

#### 7.1.1 Pre-Assignment Validation
```javascript
// Pseudo-code for assignment validation
function validateAssignment(caseId, supportPersonAlias) {
    // Check if support person exists and is active
    if (!supportPersonExists(supportPersonAlias)) {
        throw new ValidationError("INVALID_SUPPORT_PERSON");
    }
    
    // Check workload capacity
    if (getSupportPersonWorkload(supportPersonAlias) >= getMaxCapacity(supportPersonAlias)) {
        throw new ValidationError("WORKLOAD_CAPACITY_EXCEEDED");
    }
    
    // Check case status allows assignment
    if (!canAssignToCase(caseId)) {
        throw new ValidationError("CASE_NOT_ASSIGNABLE");
    }
    
    return true;
}
```

#### 7.1.2 Reasoning Validation
```javascript
function validateReasoning(reasoning) {
    // Length validation
    if (reasoning && reasoning.length > 2000) {
        throw new ValidationError("REASONING_TOO_LONG");
    }
    
    // Content validation
    if (reasoning && containsInappropriateContent(reasoning)) {
        throw new ValidationError("INAPPROPRIATE_REASONING_CONTENT");
    }
    
    return true;
}
```

## 8. Security and Compliance

### 8.1 Privacy Considerations

#### 8.1.1 Reasoning Content Guidelines
- **PRI-001**: Reasoning text SHALL not include customer names or contact information
- **PRI-002**: Reasoning SHALL focus on technical factors rather than personal assessments

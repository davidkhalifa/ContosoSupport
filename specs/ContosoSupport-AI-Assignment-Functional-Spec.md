## Functional Specification Document

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** July 28, 2025  
**Document Type:** Functional Specification  
**Service:** ContosoSupport REST API Extension

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This document specifies the functional requirements for extending the existing ContosoSupport REST service with an AI-powered support person assignment capability. The extension adds a new endpoint that automatically assigns the most suitable support representative to a ticket based on AI analysis and reasoning.

---

## 2. Current System Overview

### 2.1 Existing ContosoSupport Service
The ContosoSupport service is a REST-based API that provides comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing support tickets. The service handles:

- **Ticket Creation**: New support requests from customers
- **Ticket Retrieval**: Fetching ticket details and status
- **Ticket Updates**: Modifying ticket information and status
- **Ticket Deletion**: Removing resolved or invalid tickets

### 2.2 Current Limitations
- Manual assignment of support personnel to tickets
- No intelligent routing based on ticket complexity or subject matter
- Potential delays in assignment during high-volume periods
- Inconsistent assignment quality based on human judgment

---

## 3. Extension Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements

#### 3.1.1 AI-Powered Assignment Engine
- **FR-001**: The system SHALL implement an AI-powered assignment engine that analyzes ticket content and assigns the most appropriate support person
- **FR-002**: The assignment engine SHALL consider multiple factors including (_this is subject to change_):
  - Ticket category and complexity
  - Support person expertise and availability
  - Current workload distribution
  - Historical performance metrics
  - Customer priority level

#### 3.1.2 Assignment Method
- **FR-003**: The system SHALL provide a new REST endpoint `assignsupportperson` that accepts only a case number as input
- **FR-004**: The method SHALL return the complete updated support ticket with assigned support person alias
- **FR-005**: The method SHALL provide AI reasoning for the assignment decision
- **FR-009**: If a person has been previously assigned, the system will assign a new support person and return the updated support ticket, with updated support person alias and updated reasoning

#### 3.1.3 Response Requirements
- **FR-006**: The response SHALL include the complete ticket object with populated support person alias
- **FR-007**: The response SHALL include a detailed AI reasoning explanation for the assignment
- **FR-008**: The response SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing ticket object structure

### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements

#### 3.2.1 Performance
- **NFR-001**: The assignment process SHALL complete within 5 seconds for 95% of requests
- **NFR-002**: The system SHALL support concurrent assignment requests up to 100 per minute

#### 3.2.2 Reliability
- **NFR-003**: The system SHALL have 99.9% uptime availability

#### 3.2.3 Security
- **NFR-006**: AI reasoning data SHALL be logged for audit purposes
